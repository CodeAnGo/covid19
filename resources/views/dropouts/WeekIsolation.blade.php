                When to end your stay at home

                You should remain at home until 7 days after your symptoms started.
                <br><br>
                After 7 days, if you feel better and no longer have a high temperature, you can go back to doing what you would normally do.
                <br><br>
                The cough may go on for some weeks in some people, even though the coronavirus infection has cleared. A cough by itself does not mean you have to stay at home for more than 7 days.
                <br><br>
                If you do not get better after 7 days use the 111 online assessment service again before you leave your home or let visitors in.
